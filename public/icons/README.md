# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

You can create these icons using any image editing software. For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares as temporary icons.

To create placeholder icons quickly, you can use online tools or image editors to create PNG files with the required dimensions.
